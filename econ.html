            <h2>The Global Chocolate Economy</h2>
            
            <div class="content-with-image">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>The chocolate industry presents a complex economic narrative of both opportunity and challenge. At the heart of this $130+ billion market lies a stark contrast: while global chocolate consumption continues to rise, particularly in emerging markets, many cocoa farmers struggle to earn a living wage. West African nations, particularly CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Ghana, produce about 70% of the world's cocoa, yet most farmers in these regions earn less than $1 per day.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>The industry's supply chain reveals significant economic disparities. While major chocolate manufacturers report billions in annual profits, only about 6% of the value of a chocolate bar reaches cocoa farmers. This inequity has sparked initiatives for fair trade practices and sustainable sourcing, though their impact remains debated. Some companies have committed to paying premium prices for certified cocoa, creating new market opportunities for farmers who can meet these standards.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Market dynamics also play a crucial role. Cocoa prices fluctuate dramatically due to factors ranging from weather conditions to political instability in producing regions. These variations affect everyone from small-scale farmers to large manufacturers, though their ability to absorb these shocks varies greatly. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the industry's vulnerabilities, disrupting supply chains and changing consumer behaviors.</p>

                    <p>Despite these challenges, chocolate continues to drive economic growth in various ways. It supports millions of jobs worldwide, from farming to manufacturing to retail. Innovation in the industry, particularly in premium and craft chocolate markets, has created new business opportunities. Additionally, chocolate tourism, from factory tours to cocoa farm visits, generates significant revenue for many communities. However, addressing the economic inequalities within the industry remains a critical challenge for ensuring its sustainable future.</p>
